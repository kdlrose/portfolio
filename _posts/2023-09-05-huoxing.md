i love sailor mars because she goes to catholic school. i do not know a lot about shinto but the image in the manga (and crystal s2e1) of a miko being taught by sisters (in my mind, either Ursulines or RSCJ; I hope the latter for the image of a flaming heart ❤️‍🔥) is so primal and historically rich.

i have a lot of affection for 90s anime rei, but rei the misandrist, who out of her miko kimono or school uniform chooses for herself quite conservative clothes, is someone only a woman could have written in a shoujo magazine. i think young girls should see both usagi and mamoru's sweet, progressively sensual relationship *alongside* mars' past life vow of chastity to princess serenity.

sailor moon went off air 16 days before i was born. the main anime of my childhood was pokemon. i would see sailor moon syndicated on cartoon network, but i was raised by a mother who hates girls, who ridiculed any *kikay* behaviors, even just laughter. not only is rei so ladylike for luna to think she has a princess' bearing, rei loves to be feminine and wants nothing to do with men.

i'm a western astrologer. in my own birth chart, my moon and mars are conjoined, but in different signs: moon 28 virgo, mars 3 libra. i thought of usagi and rei in the anime when i first puzzled over this placement. mars hates being in libra. i like manga rei because her coldness seems antithetical, but i think she embodies mars the malefic, and worse, mars in detriment (libra or taurus). she ought to be similarly somber to hotaru. i am so sad naoko takeuchi didn't seem to ever draw rei and hotaru together, especially since i find minako and makoto just *are* benefic (makoto's romanticism is so piscean, venus is exalted in pisces, minako's late introduction balances the ensemble). in all three continuities, rei and hotaru are connected, somewhat, by rei's pyromancy, the prophet and the harbinger. times like that, 90s rei's brashness and immaturity seem at odds with her mysticism. then again, from what i know about medieval christian mystics, silliness and youth are no deterrent to visions.

the songs that make me think of sailor mars are grimes' [Kill V. Maim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2EJMd7ZN7w) and GIDLE's [HWAA 火花](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3szNvgQxHo). HWAA puns with the first character of her last name: huo 火 fire, then hua 花 flower. of course, soyeon took the latter character from shuhua's name and the whole I BURN aesthetic used mostly red flowers, but i think of casablanca lillies.

most the sailor senshi's surnames are their planets according to the wuxing 五行 plus 野 no; xing 行 is star, so mars is fire star, mercury is water star, jupiter is wood star. to the average western (babylonian -> hellenistic) or indian astrologer, the elemental assignments in sailor moon are odd, but the only crosscultural consistency is mars and fire. in alchemy, the seven classical planets[^1]--including the luminaries--correspond to seven metals. sun and moon are gold and silver, mercury is quicksilver, venus is copper, mars is iron, jupiter is tin, saturn is lead. iron makes sense for the god of war. blacksmiths, forging iron (*ferrum*, Fe) into steel in fire.
